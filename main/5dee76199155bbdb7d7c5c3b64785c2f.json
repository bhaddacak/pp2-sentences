In case a bhikkhunī living in dependence on a certain village or town is a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct — whose depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families she has corrupted are both seen and heard about — the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: \"You, lady, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, lady. Enough of your staying here.\""
