Should any bhikkhunī, in what is reckoned a theft, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness — just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish her, saying, \"You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief\" — a bhikkhunī in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no longer in affiliation."
