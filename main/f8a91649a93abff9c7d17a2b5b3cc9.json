Should any bhikkhunī, when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited every half-month, say, \"Just now have I learned that this case, too, is handed down in the Pāṭimokkha, is included in the Pāṭimokkha, and comes up for recitation every half-month\"; and if the bhikkhunīs should know, \"That bhikkhunī has already sat through two or three recitations of the Pāṭimokkha, if not more,\" the bhikkhunī is not exempted for being ignorant. Whatever the offense she has committed, she is to be dealt with in accordance with the rule; and in addition, her deceit is to be exposed: \"It is no gain foryou, lady,it is ill-done, that when the Pāṭimokkha is being recited, you do not pay attention, properly taking it to heart.\" As for the deception, it is to be confessed."
