    "transtext" : "16. In case a bhikkhunī is by nature difficult to admonish — who, when being legitimately admonished by the bhikkhunīs with reference to the training rules included in the (Pāṭimokkha) recitation, makes herself unadmonishable, (saying,) \"Do not, ladies, say anything to me, good or bad; and I won't say anything to the ladies, good or bad. Refrain, ladies, from admonishing me\" — the bhikkhunīs are to admonish her thus: \"Let the lady not make herself unadmonishable. Let the lady make herself admonishable. Let the lady admonish the bhikkhunīs in accordance with what is right, and the bhikkhunīs will admonish the lady in accordance with what is right; for it is thus that the Blessed One's following is nurtured: through mutual admonition, through mutual rehabilitation.\""
