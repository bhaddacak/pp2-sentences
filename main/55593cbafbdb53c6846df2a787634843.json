    "transtext" : "28. In case a man or woman householder unrelated (to the bhikkhunī) has robe-cloth woven by weavers for the sake of a bhikkhunī, and if the bhikkhunī, not previously invited (by the householder), having approached the weavers, should make stipulations with regard to the cloth, saying, \"This cloth, friends, is to be woven for my sake. Make it long, make it broad, make it tightly woven, well woven, well spread, well scraped, well smoothed, and perhaps Imayreward you with a little something\"; and should that bhikkhunī, having said that, reward them with a little something, even as much as almsfood, it (the cloth) is to be forfeited and confessed."
