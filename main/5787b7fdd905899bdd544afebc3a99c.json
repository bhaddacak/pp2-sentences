   "transtext": "Very enjoyable, sir. Very enjoyable, sir. The Dhamma illustrated by the Blessed One in various ways as such, sir, [is] like turning up what is faced downwards, or exposing what is covered, or telling the direction to a lost one, or holding an oil lamp in the dark [by thinking that] \"Those having eyes will see images.\"\nWe, sir, go to the Blessed One, also the Dhamma and the Sangha, as the refuge."
