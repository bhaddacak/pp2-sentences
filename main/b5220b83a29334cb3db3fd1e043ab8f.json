    "transtext" : "That Venerable Gotama [has] a charming reputation diffused thus: The Buddha [is] an arahant, the perfectly Enlightened One, one who has perfect wisdom and virtue, one who has gone well, one who knows the world, the Unsurpassed One, the trainer of humans, the teacher of gods and humans, the Enlightened One, [and] the Blessed One. He, having realized this world including gods, Māras, Brahmās, ascetics and brahmans, mankind, gods and humans by his own special knowledge, [then] makes [it] known. He expounds the Dhamma beautifully in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end. [He] makes known completely the purified religious life including sense and letters. Seeing arhants as such is good."
