# Sentence collection of P훮li Platform 2

This is the main collection of sentences bundled in `P훮li Platform 2`. Since these sentences are vulnerable to change, and easily spoiled or destroyed unintendedly. So, it is a good idea to have a backup of them.

The good thing for these to be present here is we have only one main version online which you can restore to your program at any time, by placing the `main` folder in `data/sentences` directory. You can also change 'main' to other name and load it afterwards, in case you want to retain your 'main'.

Users with a Github account can contribute to the project by proposing their corrections and additions via *pull request* mechanism. That will be grateful to all P훮li learners.
