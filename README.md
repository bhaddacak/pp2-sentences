# Sentence collection of Pāli Platform 2

This is the main collection of sentences bundled in `Pāli Platform 2`, and subsequebtly `Pāli Platform Classic`. (The both programs are now discontinued, and the newer and preferable `Pāli Platform 3` is not bundled with this set of sentences.) Since these sentences are vulnerable to change, and easily spoiled or destroyed unintendedly. So, it is a good idea to have a backup of them.

The good thing for these to be present here is we have only one main version online which you can restore to your program at any time, by placing the `main` folder in directory `data/sentences/`. You can also change 'main' to other name and load it afterwards, in case you want to retain your 'main'.

Users with a Github account can contribute to the project by proposing their corrections and additions via *pull request* mechanism. That will be grateful to all Pāli learners.
